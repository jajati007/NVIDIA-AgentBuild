# NVIDIA-AgentBuild
Learn how to create AI agents that can perform complex tasks using Large Language Models (LLMs) and tools.

The Build An Agent Workshop is a comprehensive, hands-on learning experience that teaches you how to create, deploy, and evaluate AI agents using NVIDIA technology. Through seven progressive modules, you'll build intelligent systems that can perform complex tasks, learn to implement Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and master the art of evaluating, improving, and securing agent performance.

This workshop provides everything you need to become proficient in agentic AI development:

Module 1 - Build an Agent: Create a Report Generation Agent that researches topics and writes comprehensive reports.
Module 2 - Agentic RAG: Build an IT Help Desk agent using RAG with NVIDIA NeMo Retriever.
Module 3 - Agent Evaluation: Learn to measure and improve agent quality using RAGAS metrics and LLM-as-a-judge techniques.
Module 4 - Agent Customization: Customize your agent beyond prompt engineering and tools with agent skills and reinforcement learning (RL).
Module 5 - Deep Agents: Build deep agents that autonomously handle complex, multi-step tasks—and learn to run them safely and securely in production with sandboxing and isolation.
Module 6 - Agent Safety: Secure autonomous agents with kernel-level enforcement (via OpenShell) and privacy routing using NVIDIA's NemoClaw stack.
Module 7 - Agent Harnesses & Skills: Separate the harness layer from the LLM, survey harness architectures from OpenClaw to pi to Claude Code, and supercharge any of them with portable, GPU-accelerated NVIDIA Verified Skills.

At the end of this workshop, you will take home:

Deep understanding of agent architecture and design patterns
Seven working agents demonstrating different capabilities
Knowledge of NVIDIA NIM, NeMo models, and evaluation tools
Comprehensive evaluation framework for production agents
A turn-key, portable development environment
Best practices for continuous agent improvement
The entire workshop can take anywhere from 14 to 21 hours to complete, depending on depth of exploration.

🤖 Learn with an AI tutor (optional)
This repo ships a set of Agent Skills that turn a coding agent into a hands-on workshop tutor. It explains each module's concepts in the workshop's own framing, gives graduated hints — without ever completing your exercises or revealing answer keys — interprets agent behavior, and troubleshoots the environment. It's an optional companion to the notebooks; you stay in the driver's seat.

The skills work in either harness — use whichever you prefer. Same content; the Agent Skills format is cross-harness. Only the way you invoke a skill differs:

Claude Code reads them from .claude/skills/ — invoke with a slash, e.g. /workshop, /module-3.
Codex reads them from .agents/skills/ — invoke with a dollar sign, e.g. $workshop, $module-3 (or run /skills to pick from a menu).
In both, you can also just describe what you need (e.g. "help me with Module 3") and the matching skill loads automatically.

Available skills: workshop (overview + router), module-1 … module-7 (one per module), and setup-workshop (local install helper) — prefix with / in Claude Code or $ in Codex.

Two ways to use it — pick whichever fits how you're running the workshop:

Inside DevX-Lab (nothing to install). Both claude and codex are preinstalled in the workshop container. Open a Terminal in JupyterLab — or, on desktop AI Workbench, the bundled VS Code app — and run either harness:
- claude — on first launch paste an Anthropic API key (get one at https://console.anthropic.com), or
- codex — on first launch sign in with codex login (ChatGPT account) or set OPENAI_API_KEY.

This harness credential is separate from your NVIDIA key. Then start the tutor — in Claude Code type /workshop to get oriented (or /module-3); in Codex type $workshop (or $module-3, or run /skills to pick from a menu). The skills load automatically because you're running inside the project. (If a CLI isn't found — e.g. an older build — run sudo npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code or sudo npm install -g @openai/codex once.)
Against a local clone. Prefer your own machine/editor? Install your harness (npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code or npm install -g @openai/codex), clone this repo, and run claude or codex from the repo root — the skills load automatically.
What the tutor will and won't do: it's guide-only by design — it won't run GPU training, drive the live agent/sandbox/red-team, or fill in exercise blanks for you. Genuine setup/environment problems (keys, Docker, a broken control plane, OOM) it will help you fix directly.

Persistence: the container persists each harness's settings and memory across rebuilds. Claude Code keeps credentials outside its volume, so you'll re-enter the Anthropic API key after a rebuild; Codex stores auth inside ~/.codex/, so a single codex login persists across rebuilds.
